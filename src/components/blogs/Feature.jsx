      Also known as temporary investments or marketable securities,
      short-term investments can be converted into cash with ease.
      Short-term investment plans are thus highly liquid; they allow
      investors to reap the benefits much sooner than longer-term
      ones—usually in less than five years. For investors looking to
      meet short-term financial goals, this is a go-to choice

      A disclaimer, though, is that sometimes, the returns the investor
      hopes to earn while investing can be wiped off by high transaction
      costs. Profits from a short-term investment stint can also be
      affected by taxation or inflation. To take advantage of short-term
      investing and avoid costly mistakes, the investor needs to know
      how all of this works.

      How do short-term investment plans work?
    </div>
    <div className="text-[13px] font-normal mt-8">
      Short-term investment plans are designed to benefit companies,
      individual investors, and institutions that invest funds. They aim
      to protect capital and generate returns much like a savings
      account

      As short-term investment plans come with their share of benefits
      and risks, they are usually preferred by investors who have a
      strong cash flow. Investors with sound financials are better
      placed to set aside excess funds for purchasing stocks, bonds, and
      other securities—all options that could fetch good investment
      returns
